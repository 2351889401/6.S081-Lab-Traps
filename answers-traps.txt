(1)According to the Calling Convention, registers a0, a1, and a2 
contain the three arguments of the "printf" function. 
Specifically, a0 holds the address of the string, a1 holds argument 12, 
and a2 holds argument 13.

(2)It appears that the calls to the functions f and g 
in "main" have been optimized out.

(3)"printf" is located at 0x630.

(4)Before the "jalr" instruction, the value in the ra register is 0x30.
After executing the "jalr" instruction and entering the "printf" function, 
the value in the ra register becomes 0x38.

(5)The output is "HE110 World".
"i" should be set to 0x726c6400.
57616 doesn't need to change.

(6)Based on the program's output and the debugging process with gdb, 
it is observed that the output of "y=" corresponds to the value of register a2. 
The assembly instructions generated by the statement "printf("x=%d y=%d", 3)" 
differ from the original assembly instructions generated by 
"printf("%d %d\n", f(8)+1, 13)" only by the absence of the instruction "li a2, 13". 
However, the subsequent sequence of assembly instructions remains the same. 
Therefore, the output of "y=" corresponds to the value stored in register a2.
